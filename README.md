Notes for windows users
-----------------------
AlphaLemon CMS has been written on a linux system machine, so you might encounter some small issues when
you work on a windows machine:

- assetic:dump command might return an error
- Skin problems

None of those problems breaks the usability of AlphaLemon CMS. If you are a windows user and you want
to fix them on your own, fork the repository, do the fixes then ask for a pull request: it would be really
appreciated! :)

Enjoy!
